/**
 * Visit a browser URL under the `/discovery/` journey prefix and prove the document really
 * was fetched from that prefixed URL.
 *
 * A plain `cy.visit('/resources')` cannot be caught by `cy.location()`: vue-router's
 * `normalizeBase` trims the base to `/discovery`, `stripBase` leaves an un-prefixed pathname
 * untouched, and the bootstrap `history.replaceState` then rewrites the address bar to
 * `/discovery/resources`. The app therefore *looks* prefixed while the document was served by
 * nginx's un-prefixed `location /` debug fallback — a shape that does not exist behind
 * welcome nginx or the ALB. `PerformanceNavigationTiming.name` records the URL that was
 * actually fetched and is not rewritten by `replaceState`, so it is the honest check.
